    <p>Biryani is a celebrated, aromatic rice dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, renowned for its complex layering of fragrant long-grain basmati rice, marinated meat (typically chicken, mutton, or goat), and a rich blend of spices like saffron, cardamom, and cinnamon. The dish is traditionally prepared using the dum pukht method, where ingredients are slow-cooked in a sealed vessel to trap steam and infuse deep flavors. While its name is derived from the Persian word birian (meaning "fried before cooking"), biryani evolved into a diverse culinary icon with distinct regional varieties, such as the spicy Hyderabadi, the subtle and fragrant Lucknowi, and the Kolkata version, which uniquely includes potatoes and boiled eggs. </p>
