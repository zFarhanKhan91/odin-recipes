    <p>Lassi is a traditional yogurt-based drink originating from the Indian subcontinent, prepared by blending yogurt with water and various flavorings until frothy. It is primarily served chilled and comes in two main styles: a sweet version often infused with sugar, rosewater, or fruit (like mango), and a savory version seasoned with salt and roasted cumin. Beyond its popularity as a refreshing summer beverage, lassi is valued in Ayurvedic traditions for its cooling properties and its ability to aid digestion through natural probiotics.</p>
